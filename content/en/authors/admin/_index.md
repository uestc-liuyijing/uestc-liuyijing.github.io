Hi, I am Yijing Liu (刘贻静)

I am currently serving as an associated professor at the National Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, University of Electronic Science and technology. I received Ph.D. degree at the University of Electronic Science and technology in 2023, under the supervision of **prof. Gang Feng**. I was also a visiting Ph.D. student at the College of Computing and Data Science, under the supervision of **prof. Dusit Niyato**, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, from 2022 to 2023.


Currently, my focus is on the integration of distributed machine learning and intelligent wireless networks from the perspectives of “Distributed Learning for Wireless Networks” and “Wireless Networks for Distributed Learning”.
